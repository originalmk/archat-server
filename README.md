Simple P2P server (and client - for testing purposes only, client for end user will be written in NodeJS using Electron, soon).

## Starting
You can use these commands to start client and/or server:

```
go run . client
```
Note that server should be started **before** running client.

```
go run . server
```

For now, address of server is hardcoded in client, and server starts on `localhost:8080`.
